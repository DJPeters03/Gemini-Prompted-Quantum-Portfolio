This project is a prompt coded linear demonstration of how far quantum mechancis have come. All projects were generated by Gemini through specific prompts, which are at the end of the file

1. The project starts with the origin of quantum, showing how physics reached a new chapter of discovery 

2. The project then goes to quantum theory, demonstrating some of the weirdness that quantum physics had 

3. Next the project goes to quantum computing, showing some of the cool animations made with qubits and qudits. 

4. After that I linked quantum to self learning AI agents, showing that quantum could be used as an environment or an agent depending on its task

5. Finally, the project ends with Qsharp programs, these are programs that deal with qubits directly allowing us to build better quantum tools with less lines of code. 

All prompts are saved in a PDF beneath the folders
