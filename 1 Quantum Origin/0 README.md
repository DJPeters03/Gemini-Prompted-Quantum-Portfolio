Quantum Origin — From Heat to Quantization

This folder is the starting point of the quantum story.

The files here recreate the exact historical failure of classical physics and then progressively introduce the ideas that force quantization to exist. Each visualization answers one question and intentionally creates the need for the next.

Core theme:
Classical physics predicts infinite energy.
Reality does not.
Something fundamental must be discrete.

The Crisis: Classical Physics Breaks

This visualization recreates the black body radiation problem.

You can:
	•	Heat a furnace
	•	Watch emitted light change color
	•	Compare classical Rayleigh–Jeans theory vs Planck’s curve

What it teaches:
	•	Classical physics predicts infinite energy at high frequencies (UV catastrophe)
	•	Reality follows a finite, peaked distribution

Key takeaway:

The universe is rejecting classical assumptions.

Why the Catastrophe Happens

This file explains why the black body calculation explodes.

You can:
	•	Increase the number of standing wave modes inside a cavity
	•	Watch higher frequencies pack infinitely into the same space

What it teaches:
	•	Light inside a box forms standing waves
	•	Classical physics gives every mode equal energy
	•	Infinite modes → infinite energy

Key takeaway:

The problem isn’t heat — it’s how energy is distributed.

Planck’s Fix: Energy Has a Cost

This visualization introduces Planck’s radical idea:

Energy exchange depends on frequency.

You can:
	•	Increase frequency (energy cost)
	•	Increase temperature (available energy)
	•	Watch high frequencies get blocked unless paid for

What it teaches:
	•	Energy comes in packets
	•	High-frequency modes are suppressed
	•	This naturally prevents the UV catastrophe

Key takeaway:

Nature filters energy in discrete steps.

Quantization Enters Matter

This file transitions quantum ideas from light to atoms.

You can:
	•	Change orbit radius
	•	Watch electron waves either reinforce or self-destruct
	•	Lock into stable orbits where waves close perfectly

What it teaches:
	•	Electrons behave like waves
	•	Only certain orbits are allowed
	•	Atomic structure is quantized by geometry

Key takeaway:

Quantization isn’t a trick — it’s structural.

How This Folder Connects Forward

This folder intentionally stops right before the concept of the quantum of action.

At this point, we know:
	•	Energy exchange is discrete
	•	Frequency determines energy cost
	•	Matter itself obeys wave constraints

What we haven’t named yet is the constant that controls all of it.
